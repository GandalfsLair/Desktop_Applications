WHAT IS FORCE PAIR TERMINAL?

A program that is will only work correctly on a laptop or desktop.

(The fact that the one HTML file calls another HTML file means it will not run on a browser due to CORS issues)
(CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - A google search will give you all the information you need to understand the issue)

The code runs and a progress bar is filled.
When the bar fills, the program makes a determination between one of two outcomes (Pass or Fail) 

If the program determines a 'Pass' then the user is presented with five buttons;

UPLOAD
DOWNLOAD
PROXY
RESET
EXIT

All of these buttons currently display a progress bar and a message.

All of the messages and data can be amended as needed.
